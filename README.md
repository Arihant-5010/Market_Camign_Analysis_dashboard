# Market_Camign_Analysis_dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of marketing campaign performance across various channels, campaign types, and customer segments. It enables data-driven decision-making by visualizing key metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversion rate, and ROI.

**Business Problem**

Despite a high number of impressions and a large volume of clicks , the overall conversion rate remains relatively low and the return on investment (ROI) averages 5.0. The business needs to identify which campaign types, marketing channels, and customer segments are truly driving conversions and returns.

The goal is to uncover high-performing combinations and optimize underperforming areas to:

Increase conversion rates

Maximize marketing ROI

Allocate budget more efficiently

**Key Insights**

**Campaign Types**: All campaign types (Influencer, Search, Display, Social Media, Email) perform similarly (~98.4%), making performance differentiation challenging.

**Channels Used**: Google Ads, Instagram, and YouTube show high activity, but a deeper analysis is required to evaluate their conversion effectiveness.

**Customer Segments**: Segments like Foodies, Tech Enthusiasts, and Outdoor Adventurers receive equal focus, but impact on ROI is unclear.

**Seasonality**: Fluctuations in impressions across months suggest opportunities to better time campaigns for higher engagement.
